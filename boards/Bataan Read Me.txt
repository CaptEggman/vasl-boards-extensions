Bataan Vasl Map Version 1.0 released September 2012. Drawn by Pete Roberts

This is a hand-drawn version of Critical Hit's Bataan map, there may be slight differences in LOS and terrain depictions from the original.

Thanks to Ray Tapio at Critical Hit for permission to VASLize the maps.

The extension adds the counters from Critical Hit's Bataan to the American order of battle.
 
Philippine army tabs have been added to American unit Squad and Half Squad tabs. Philippine Army counters differ from the regular army counters in that they have no assault fire and have a reduced smoke exponent.

A Carabao counter has been added to the American SW White tab and a TNT DC counter has been added to the American SW LATW tab.
