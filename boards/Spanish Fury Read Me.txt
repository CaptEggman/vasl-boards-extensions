Spanish Fury Vasl Maps 1 and 2 Version 1.0 released August 2012. Drawn by Pete Roberts

These are hand-drawn versions of Critical Hit's Spanish Fury maps, there may be slight differences in LOS and terrain depictions from the originals

Thanks to Ray Tapio at Critical Hit for permission to VASLize the maps.

The extension adds counters from Critical Hit's Spanish Fury.
 
A Blau Division Tab has been added under the German OOB. These counters are not strictly necessary for playing Spanish Fury scenarios, normal German unit counters can be used instead.
