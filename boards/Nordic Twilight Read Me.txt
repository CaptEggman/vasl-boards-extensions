Nordic Twilight Vasl Map Version 1.0 released August 2012. Drawn by Pete Roberts

This is a hand-drawn version of Critical Hit's Nordic Twilight map, there may be slight differences in LOS and terrain depictions from the original.

Thanks to Ray Tapio at Critical Hit for permission to VASLize the map and thanks also to Duncan Raeburn for scanning the map for me.

Note that the Vasl Terrain SSR to change the map to ground snow will work and has been changed slightly so that the Marsh hexes change to mudflats and the water does not turn to ice.
