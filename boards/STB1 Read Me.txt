STB1 Vasl Map Version 1.0 released Sept 2011. Drawn by Pete Roberts

This is a hand-drawn version of Critical Hit's Scotland The Brave map, there may be slight differences in LOS and terrain depictions from the original

STB1 is intended to replace an existing STB map using an updated colour scheme and is designed to link up with STB2

To join the maps just load STB2 and add a row and select STB1.

Thanks to Ray Tapio at Critical Hit for permission to VASLize the map.
