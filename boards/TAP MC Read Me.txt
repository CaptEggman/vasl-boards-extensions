Critical Hit's maps from TAP1 and TAP2 include MC1 to MC7 (MC7 is also known as TPX1).

When a scenario requires joining of Boards MC2 and MC5 use MC2a and MC5a.

The snow boards for MC1, MC2 and MC5 can be used when scenario weather is snow.

These are hand painted Maps representations of Critical hits maps using a mixture of Vasl colour schemes and Critical Hit terrain.

The LOS engine and Terrain transformations will not work on these maps as they are restricted to Geo-morphic boards.

Roll Low.
