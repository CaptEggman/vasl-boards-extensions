Red Christmas - Orlovo Vasl Map Version 1.0 released June 2011. Drawn by Pete Roberts

This is a hand-drawn version of Critical Hit's Red Christmas - Orlovo map, there may be slight differences in LOS and terrain depictions from the original

Thanks to Ray Tapio at Critical Hit for permission to VASLize this map.

This map supports most of the Terrain Changes within Vasl - specifically it will support changes to Snow conditions.
