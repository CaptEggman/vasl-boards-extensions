Carnage at Cassino VASL Map 
Version 1.0 released 7/8/10. 
Drawn by Pete Roberts 

This is a hand-drawn version of the Carnage at Cassino map, there may be slight differences 
in LOS from the original. The map colours and Terrain depictions have been changed from the original in an effort to make the map easier on the eye.

Please note that each alternate Hex Column starting with Column A will be reported by Vasl as 1 greater than it actually is i.e. A1 and C1 will be reported by Vasl logs as A2 and C2 respectively. The B, D, F (etc) columns will report correctly. The numbering on the actual map is the correct grid numbering.



Thanks to Ray Tapio at Critical Hit for permission to VASLize this map.
