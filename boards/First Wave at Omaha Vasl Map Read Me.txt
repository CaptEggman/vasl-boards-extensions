Vasl First Wave at Omaha Map Version 1.0 
drawn by Peter Roberts released 6/4/10 with permission of Ray Tapio at Critical Hit.

PLEASE READ

This is a large map and it is recommended that you set Vasl preferences to "Prefer memory mapped files for large images" when using it.

Overlays for the German Wn set up areas and the different tide times are available via Terrain SSR under "Omaha Tide Times and Wn Set Up".

Due to the size of the map and the overlays you may experience a delay as the map image is built and it is recommended that only one overlay is set at any one time.

I.E. reset the map between the loading of the different overlays.

This is a hand drawn version of the Omaha map and therefore there may be slight differences in LOS from the original, but none of any consequence.

Note also that the AT ditch depiction on the map is slightly different from the red depiction on the original map.

Thanks to Jeffrey Malter AKA CountermanCX for his review of the map and suggestions for improvement.
