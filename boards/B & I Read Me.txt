Critical Hit's Board & Iron - In The Item Pocket Version 1.0 drawn by Pete Roberts 2/09/10

Note that this is a hand drawn map and therefore LOS may vary slightly from the original, note also that the terrain art is slightly different from the original.

The BICaves MDX extension has added the Blood and Iron preset cave Complexes to the draggable overlays under a tab called BI Caves. The overlays are transparent and do not snap to teh map grid. After roughly setting them up I would recommend zooming in on the map to fine tune the placement so that they fit with the map grid exactly. Aftre placement HIP the cave complex by Ctrl H or right click menu option.

Thanks to Ray Tapio for permission to release for Vasl use.
