Critical Hit's Ordeal before Shuri Version 1.0 drawn by Pete Roberts 8/9/10

Note that this is a hand drawn map and therefore LOS and terrain artwork may vary slightly from the original.

Although the LOS thread can be used on the map Vasl will not show whether it is blocked or not. Players will have to make a call just as they do on the tabletop.

Thanks to Ray Tapio for permission to release for Vasl use.
