Tyrants Lair Vasl Map Version 1.0 released 11/1/11. Drawn by Pete Roberts 

This is a hand-drawn version of the Tyrants Lair map, there may be slight differences in LOS from the original and the terrain depictions may also differ slightly.

NOTE: This map can be joined to the existing BERLIN Vasl map. Load the BERLIN map first, then add a row and load the Tyrants Lair map. For a best fir crop the BERLIN map to use coordinates 1 to 36 and the TL map to use coordinates 37 to 77 (it isn't a perfect fit but good enough).

NOTE: The TL map has three hexrows beyond ZZ which Vasl cropping does not recognise, so although the board can be cropped for most scenarios, this is not possible for any scenarios using hexrows AAA, BBB and CCC (Scenarios 2,4,5,8 and 15).

TL EXTENSION: The Tyrants Lair extension adds a separate map window to Vasl. The map can be accessed from a button on the top menu bar which toggles the map window on and off. Counters can be moved to/from and on the map window which contains the enlarged play aid areas for the Zoo Flak tower, The Reich Air Ministry, The Reichstag and the Fuhrer and Vor bunkers.

The extension also adds the following counters to the counter tray:

Bridge Debris counter (Info Locate Bridge)
Two cleared arrow marker counters for AT barricade clearance (Info Destroy Basic)
Pantherturm (Info Fortify Cupola)
Panzerturm  (Info Fortify Cupola)
Wilton-Fijenoord AC (German Vehicles AC)
OT 34/85 (Russian Vehicles Tank MT)
Red Banner 1pp (Russian SW LATW)
