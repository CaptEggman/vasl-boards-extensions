BOB DZN Vasl Map Version 1.0 released June 2011. Drawn by Pete Roberts

This is a hand-drawn version of Critical Hit's BOB Drop Zone Normandy map, there may be slight differences in LOS and terrain depictions from the original

Thanks to Ray Tapio at Critical Hit for permission to VASLize this map.

This map supports most of the Terrain Changes within Vasl

NB that the Hedges from the original map are shown as Bocage - if for any reason you want them to appear as hedges then use the Terrain SSR Hedges are Bocage, which will actually work in reverse on this map.
